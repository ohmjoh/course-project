# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### "ohmjoh/course-project" repository includes the following files:
 - 'README.md'
 - 'run_analysis.R'
 - 'codebook.md'
 
### Notes on 'run_analysis.R':
- This is an R script which uses Samsung Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
- You can download the dataset here: http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- This script should work properly as long as you have the unzipped folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory
- This script creates two following data sets:
   1. 'avg_sub.txt': the average of each variable for each subject
   2. 'avg_act.txt': the average of each variable for each activity
- 'codebook.md' includes description of variables of 'avg_sub.txt' and 'avg_act.txt'
